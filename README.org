* Jonky - Jari's Conky
** What is it?
   An attempt to make my own conky-like tool. It'll be based on PyCairo and PyGtk. The first cut will:
   - Only allow you to write to the whole desktop
   - Only give basic drawing utilities
     - Text
     - Circles
     - Rectangles
     - Polygons
     - FontAwesome
     - Images/SVGs
     - ?
   - A mechanism to call various functions at various times
   - A mechanism for caching
   - A way to create a live wallpaper that's controlled by time of day
   - A function for adding digital clocks at various timezones
   - Functions for retrieiving system info (disk space, cpu use, ram, etc)
   - Simple time series plots
** Why?
   I'm too dumb to configure conky how I like, and I've been making something similar in an ad hoc way using feh. Time to upgrade that to something more real.
